<h1>
	Use Of Alerts
</h1>
<p>
	Alerts are used to communicate status information to the user without blocking other actions through the user interface. There are two styles that can be applied to an alert depending on whether it is intended as an inline or toast alert. Regardless of the styling, the basic elements of all alerts are consistent.
